# CART(Classification and Regression Tree) Modeling Project
This project implements the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm for Regression tasks from scratch in Python, primarily within the data2060_CART.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to provide a complete understanding of the algorithm by implementing its core components, including the tree-building process, prediction, and pruning.

## Development Environment
To run the project locally and reproduce the results, please use the following python version and required packages.

The code was developed and test using Python 3.12+.

The core dependencies for this project are:

numpy (for numerical operations)

pandas (for data handling)

matplotlib (for visualization)

pytest (for unit testing)
